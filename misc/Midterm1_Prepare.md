If you need help figuring out what you should be doing to prepare for your midterm, I’ve got you!

### Things you should do

You don’t *have* to do all of them. However, if you’d like to build a strong foundation, I’d suggest these.

- **Watch the Midterm Revision Video on Canvas**\
Get an idea of what you’re expected to know for the midterm

- **Go through the Lecture Slides** \
While this may seem obvious, the slides for COSC 111 are an incredible resource. Having seen the Midterm Revision video, you’ll know what’s important!

- **Solve the iClickers again!**  
They’re great questions to test your understanding.
Looking for the right answers? Here’s how you can see the answers to the iClickers done in class - [iClicker Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JVns_d1UFvYN8-VCsccxkuZCF5UhebGz/view?usp=drive_link)

- **Practice, practice and practice** (cliché, I know)
    - Assignments
    - Practice questions in slides
    - Lab Exercises

- **Solve the Practice Exam**\
It’s available (with solutions) in the Midterm 1 Announcement made by your Professor.

- **Make a (great) Cheat Sheet**\
Sometimes you have to work smart.
Something’s too complicated to remember? Put it on the cheat sheet.
Ex. Syntax of switch, the operator precedence table, import statements, error types, printf syntax, you get the idea.\
***Never underestimate a good cheat sheet.***

- **Practice physically writing code!**\
You gotta do what you gotta do.

- **Attend the Midterm Review!**
- **Take a break if you’re overwhelmed.**\
I get it. I really do. Midterms can be a stressful period.\
